In the paper we show that there is a lot of heterogeneity between the performance measure AUC in external validations of the same clinical prediction model. This heterogeneity cannot be estimates well if there are only a couple of external validations, in those cases the predicition interval around the AUC will be to slim. A way to fix this problem is to use a prior for the heterogeneity.
