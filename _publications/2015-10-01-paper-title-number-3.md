In the paper time series data are being used to predict changes in intercarinal pressure treatment. The proposed pipeline of the model uses tokenization to allow any data type (numerical, categorical, missing data). The tokens are then fed into an recurrent neural network (LSTM) to predict an ordinal outcome.
