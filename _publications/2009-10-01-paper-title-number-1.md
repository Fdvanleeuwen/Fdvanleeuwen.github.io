In this paper, we investigate how to estimate changes over time using interrupted time series designs. In particular we show what kind of effect sizes/sample sizes are need to obtain enough power to observe a change over time. An empirical example is used showing the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns on math scores of primary school children.
