Currently, I am a PhD student in the Methodology and Statistics department at Utrecht University. My research concerns prediction models with tabular or time series data, specifically when there is sparse information, missing data, and if we are interested in quantifying uncertainty around the estimates/models. My supervisors are [Sara van Erp](https://www.saravanerp.com) and [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com), and I am part of the missing data (MICE) and Bayesian statistics research groups.

Previously, I worked at the Leiden University Medical Center under the supervision of Ewout Steyerberg and Erik van Zwet. During this time, we assessed how to estimate the external performance of clinical prediction models. Furthermore, I aided in some projects regarding Traumatic Brain Injury. My full CV can be found [here](https://fdvanleeuwen.github.io/cv).

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in some of my work or want to collaborate.
