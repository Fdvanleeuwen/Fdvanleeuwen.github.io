Currently, I am a PhD student in the Methodology and Statistics department at Utrecht University. My research concerns prediction models with tabular or time series data. Specifically when there is sparse information, missing data and if we are intrested can quantify uncertainty around the estimates/models. Sparse information can occur, for example, in the situation when there is high-dimensional data (p>n). To help with the estimation process, priors can be used for the coefficients/weights in a model. My current work focuses on how we can obtain a good approximation of the posterior without having to wait ages for the algorithms to converge. My supervisors are [Sara van Erp](https://www.saravanerp.com) and [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com), and I am part of the missing data (MICE) and Bayesian statistics research groups. 

Previously, I worked at the Leiden University Medical Center under the supervision of Ewout Steyerberg and Erik van Zwet. During this time we assessed how to estimate the external performance of clinical prediction models. Furthermore, I aided in some projects regarding Traumatic Brain Injury.
